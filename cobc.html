          <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
          <p>Everyone at the PySangamam conference are expected to follow a code of conduct. This document shall serve as the reference point for the code, and also as a place for discussion on any rules that need to be added/changed removed.</p>
          <p>We are here as a community to deliberate on the topics of the forum. Be nice to everyone.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be empathetic</li>
            <li>Be questioning, as it furthers the discussion</li>
            <li>Discuss ideas, not people and their personalities (as that would be ad hominem)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Broadly, the following have <strong>no</strong> space in the community: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Harrassment</li>
            <li>Sexism</li>
            <li>Piracy or Spam</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="who-does-it-apply-to-">Who does it apply to?</h2>
          <p>The code of conduct is applicable equally to all members who are part of the conference. This includes: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Organizers</li>
            <li>Volunteers</li>
            <li>Speakers</li>
            <li>Sponsors</li>
            <li>Reviewers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is important to emphasize that everyone is expected to follow the rules, and can be penalised as appropriate in case of violations.</p>
          <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
          <h3 id="harrassment">Harrassment</h3>
          <p>We strongly condemn any kind of harassment of any fellow participant, speaker or representative from sponsorsâ€™ organization.</p>
          <p>Members are expected to stay civil in their discussions online as well as offline. Especially towards newer members who may be asking very basis questions or are not aware of the conventions of online conversations. Members are also expected to warn and then report any violations. Such actions will invite a warning or an immidiate ban depending on the seriousness.</p>
          <h3 id="sexism">Sexism</h3>
          <p>Members of the group shall try to make participants comfortable by not indulging into sexist behavior. They will not use nude/pornographic content while interacting with the group. They will also not use sexist references in way of humour. </p>
          <p>Being sexist includes offensive remarks or jokes made about women, men, persons of non-binary genders and those with physical disabilities, or on the basis of sexuality, race, caste or religion.</p>
          <p>Use of images that objectify the human body are heavily discouraged unless absolutely relevant to the discussion. Inappropriate physical contact and invasion of private space. Deliberate intimidation, unwelcome gestures and stalking is NOT ok.</p>
          <p>Any activities as highlighted above or anything that falls into the same bag will not be encouraged and such actions will invite a warning and a subsequent ban from the group.</p>
          <h3 id="piracy-or-spam">Piracy or Spam</h3>
          <p>Members shall not share any pirated content in online or offline discussions. This includes pirated copies of books, educational videos, softwares and torrent link to them. Any such content will be removed by moderators without warning.</p>
          <h2 id="point-of-contact">Point of contact</h2>
          <p>Please report in confidence by sending an SMS to +91 9999999999. SMSes are received by PySangamam Organizers who can address this quickly. Violators, regardless of their standing, may be expelled from the forum, without a refund (where payment was applicable), and reported to the authorities.</p>
